<br/><br/>

*We stand upon the backs of giants. This theme began as a fork of <a href="https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/i/TheCodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations" target="_blank">Synthwave x Fluoromachine & epic animations</a>, which was a fork of <a href="https://github.com/webrender/synthwave-x-fluoromachine">synthwave-x-fluoromachine</a>, wich is also fork of @robbowen's [Synthwave '84 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode), merged with @fullerenedream's [Fluoromachine](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/FluoroMachine/) theme for VSCode.*

## Why?

The job of a software developer is hard and often too serious. You always have to be productive and effective. But sometimes you need to take the time to just be a nerd ü§ì or to just have fun again. This theme is exactly for such times! Such nerdy times need to be celebrated accordingly üéâü¶Ñ

<br/> <br/>

## Installation

The following steps must be performed to install the theme:

1. Install this theme
2. Install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) vscode extension
3. Link the CSS file from this extension in your .vscode/settings.json:

```
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/awaken-the-synth-dragon-{version}/epic-80s-transitions"
    ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": ["file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/awaken-the-synth-dragon-{version}/epic-80s-transitions"]
}
```

1. `epic-80s-transitions.css` is optional (but absolutely amazing and highly recommended).

2. From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
